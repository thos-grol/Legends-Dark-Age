//FIXME: contract destruction on world map doesn't seem to work correctly anymore, go fix it.

IDEA: 
	character buttons
	assign class button
	get weapon tree button
		if don't already have weapon tree, and weapon trees < 2
	level up weapon buttons
		if has level up weapon point
	level up trait buttons
		if has level up trait point


Enemy Designs

Bandits, ruffians. They should be a threat even with the lowest tier. Poorly equipped, but has classes that can capitulize on that.
Blunt weapons, farm implements, axes.

	Bandit tiers
		Rabble & Thugs
		Veterans
		Elites

What sort of contracts involve bandits?
	Stolen goods
	Town Defense
	Camp
	Caravans

Short term
  // contracts spawned if village is above z level use barbarians instead
    
// story missions where the world heads towards a future associated with a certain god ()
// faction has enemies stored as details?
// enemies simulated faction can conflict with faction
// let's design organic factions and force level system
// preset factions
	// 1. Northern ice faction, can tame white wolves, ice knights
	//	- bandits: barbarians
	//  - big threat: undead, crisis: Necromancer's ascension ritual
	// 2. Council of Mages
	// 	- bandits: different bandit gang design
	//  - big threat: greenskins, crisis: Greenskin Tide (Two Headed Orc Mage)
	//   (camp) ghost village
	//   (camp) undead legionaries
	//   (camp) shifting woods
	// 3. Holy Kingdom
	// 	- bandits: none/theyve been purged
	//  - big threat: cultists, crisis: Davkul's advent
	//  (camp) castle of night (vampires)
	//  (camp) witches
	// 4. (Southern) Alchemists
	//  - bandits: nomads
	//  general crisis: world war
	
	//  (camp) monsters
	//  (camp) anatomists


// new mechanic = retaliations
// % chance after mission they send a retaliation based on how much hate you have
// influences the quality of units sent

// XCOM force level -> as force level increases, so too does the quality of units they field
// faction strength -> the amount of units they can devote to missions

// faction conflict, over certain resource points
// faction conflict, over schemes
// faction actions - caravan transports
// faction actions - critical caravan transports

// you cannot betray allied faction

// Golden Path mission
	// unique mission chain for each faction


// General Missions
	// claim enemy resource point
	// defend/raid caravan - raid caravan contract given by hostile nations (between town to capital)
