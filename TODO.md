Short term

// TODO: shield rework, shields are dropped onto the floor if their durability is used up, don't actually break them
// heal shield to full, make shields unable to be picked up

// How to make shieldwall better? Add some block value that mitigates damage hit duh
// add shield poise, when hit multiple times, a character becomes unsteady and loses block ability
// that way people can't turtle behind shields as we remove durability


// TODO: village tooltip: add owner, see captial relations banner?
// contracts spawned if village is above z level use barbarians instead
    
// story missions where the world heads towards a future associated with a certain god ()

// new mechanic = retaliations
