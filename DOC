//FEATURE_1: actives: you need to fix skills with DamageMinimum adding way more damage than you want
    //FEATURE_1: generate hooks for all active skills, account for legend hooks
    // - we probably want to hook all actives for editing
    // _properties.DamageRegularMin += 5;
    // _properties.DamageRegularMax += 10;

//FEATURE_1: we should have our own entity system instead of using legend's randomized abstract. This is
// in case of breaking changes

// Storage System Notes

// - start by spawning all bros in storage

//TODO: Now we need to decide on the plans of the organic faction System
// how does player interact?
// at the end of the week, resolve contracts + ongoing actions
// update strength of faction
// faction capital can only be taken if they only have 3 villages left

// southern faction can only be taken after they expand to 3 villages. Then after they have no villages, the southern faction
// can be raided
// southern faction expands after they have enough stuff

// faction resources
    // soldiers -> create actions
    // research level -> force level of units
    // researchers -> rate of research increase/crystals consumed
    // hero units (str) - unique heroes -> if they die, gone forever.
        // adding one will greatly increase the strength of mission/action
    // crystals -> resource to do everything

    // villages provide soldiers to spend on actions

    // enemies can take over villages, and even own them secretly ie. cultists
    // once they secretly own 3 villages, you can discover their plans
    // at 6 villages, cultist crisis starts, where the cultists try to take capitals
    // if a capital is taken, then the advent of davkul starts

// faction brain, decide what they lack and want to do

// resource points -> spawned on the map too, but have no owners
    // crystal mines - active 1 month in

// all faction capitals sit on default resource point, granting x resources every week

    // design force level after creating classes


// you 0 wages - can't die
// slaves, no wages but very expensive - unlocked if you start with city state or you create contact

// mercenaries have a contribution value - teaching them stuff will offset the wages you owe them.
// giving them extraordinary power too
// lv1  - no wages, basically apprentices to be trained
// lv3  - basic wages
// lv5  - decent wages
// lv7  - veteran wages
