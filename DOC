//FEATURE_1: actives: you need to fix skills with DamageMinimum adding way more damage than you want
    //FEATURE_1: generate hooks for all active skills, account for legend hooks
    // - we probably want to hook all actives for editing
    // _properties.DamageRegularMin += 5;
    // _properties.DamageRegularMax += 10;

//FEATURE_1: we should have our own entity system instead of using legend's randomized abstract. This is
// in case of breaking changes

// Storage System Notes

// - start by spawning all bros in storage


// TODO: come up with squad state system
//      - locked?
//      - current mission details
//      - current mission status
//      - need to look into data source

// TODO: button state 
// red -> locked
// normal -> highlighted (ready)
// gray -> unused


// TODO: create function for squad limit

// - set limit in party to be added (default 12)
// - if party limit > then can't add more bros to squad

// - logic? how to tell what squad to load in for mission
// - save mission details to squad?
// - lock squad from moving after mission is selected?

// - squad status:
//   - free (will have no mission, displays current mission)
//      - mission screen opens to first free squad
//   - locked - has mission info and seed
//          - squad is not modifiable
//          - on retaliation, squad is locked. cannot move or modify, mission is set
//          - locked squads are still viewable with mission display
//   - 

// after prototype is finished, make this into a new screen, and replace show strategic character
//
