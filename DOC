//FEATURE_1: actives: you need to fix skills with DamageMinimum adding way more damage than you want
    //FEATURE_1: generate hooks for all active skills, account for legend hooks
    // - we probably want to hook all actives for editing
    // _properties.DamageRegularMin += 5;
    // _properties.DamageRegularMax += 10;

//FEATURE_1: we should have our own entity system instead of using legend's randomized abstract. This is
// in case of breaking changes

// Storage System Notes
// - Fix not being able to remove last bro from party 1

// - start by spawning all bros in storage


// - add buttons to change squads

// - set limit in party to be added (default 12)
// - if party limit > then can't add more bros to squad

// - logic? how to tell what squad to load in for mission
// - save mission details to squad?
// - lock squad from moving after mission is selected?
